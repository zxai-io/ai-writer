# AI Writer

This project uses Cursor, configured with specific rules, to function as a senior content marketer and direct response copywriter. The goal is to generate clear, concise, and compelling content that explains complex topics simply and avoids common AI writing patterns.

## Getting Started

- Open this project in Cursor.
- Press `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+L` (Mac) to open Cursor's Chat UI.
- In "Agent" mode, type a command like: `@outline: Create an article about email marketing tips`
- The AI will generate an outline in the specified location (usually `.content/` folder)

**Quick Example:**

```
@outline: Write an article about content marketing strategies for small businesses
```

After generating the outline, you can proceed to write each section:

```
@write: Write the first section of the content-marketing-strategies.md outline
```

You can also customize the writing style using the vibe command:

```
@vibe: tone=casual, audience=beginners, industry=tech
```

## Core Concepts

- **Persona:** The AI adopts the persona of an experienced content marketer and copywriter.
- **Style:** Direct, informational, and concise. Avoids fluff and poetic language. Focuses on information density.
- **Human-like Output:** Emphasizes varying sentence lengths (burstiness), using simpler language, avoiding specific "AI-sounding" words and phrases, and aiming for an 8th-grade reading level.
- **Commands:** Operates with three distinct commands: `@outline`, `@write`, and `@vibe`.

## Detailed Usage Examples

### 1. Outline

To generate an article outline, provide a topic. The AI will research and propose a structure in Markdown.

**Example Prompt:**

```
@outline: Create an outline for an article explaining the basics of blockchain technology for beginners. Place it in the .content/ folder.
```

**Expected Output Structure (in `.content/blockchain-basics-for-beginners.md`):**

```markdown
# What is blockchain technology anyway

This section will introduce blockchain in simple terms, maybe using an analogy like a shared digital ledger. Explain that it's the tech behind things like Bitcoin, but has many other uses. Keep it brief and hook the reader.

## How does a blockchain actually work

Describe the core components like blocks, chains, and hashing. Explain decentralization and immutability without getting too technical. Focus on the 'what' and 'why it matters' for a beginner.

## What makes blockchain secure

Talk about cryptography and consensus mechanisms (like Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake) in very simple terms. Emphasize why it's hard to tamper with.

## Where is blockchain used today

Give a few clear examples beyond cryptocurrency. Think supply chain tracking, voting systems, or digital identity. Show the practical applications.

## Why should a beginner care about blockchain

Briefly touch on the potential impact of the technology and why understanding the basics is useful in today's world.
```

_(**Note:** The actual content descriptions will be generated by the AI based on its research)._

### 2. Write

Once you have an outline (e.g., `blockchain-basics-for-beginners.md`), instruct the AI to write the content section by section.

**Example Prompt (after outline generation):**

```
@write: Write the first section for the outline in `.content/blockchain-basics-for-beginners.md`.
```

The AI will then generate the content for the first H2 section, adhering to all the specified rules (word count, style, human-like quality, etc.). You would then prompt it sequentially for the remaining sections.

### 3. Vibe

The vibe command allows you to customize the AI Writer's tone, style, and approach without changing the underlying rules.

**Example Usage:**

```
@vibe: tone=professional, industry=finance, audience=experts
```

This would adjust the AI Writer to use more formal language, financial terminology, and assume a high level of domain knowledge in future content.

**Available Parameters:**

- **tone**: casual, professional, funny, serious, technical, conversational
- **industry**: tech, healthcare, finance, education, marketing, etc.
- **audience**: beginners, experts, children, seniors, general
- **style**: journalistic, academic, conversational, storytelling

You can reset to default settings with:

```
@vibe: reset
```

### 4. Additional Examples

**Requesting content with specific parameters:**

```
@outline: Create an outline about social media marketing trends for 2024. Include sections about TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
```

**Writing for a specific audience:**

```
@outline: Create an outline for a technical tutorial about Docker for junior developers who have never used containers before.
```

**Creating multiple sections at once:**

```
@write: Write the first two sections of the docker-beginners-guide.md outline
```

**Changing the vibe for a specific project:**

```
@vibe: tone=storytelling, audience=children, style=conversational
@outline: Create an outline for an article explaining how computers work
```

## Rules Summary

The AI follows a detailed set of rules covering:

- **Instructions:** Core persona and writing style.
- **Commands:** Specific workflows for `@outline`, `@write`, and `@vibe`.
- **Bypass AI Detection:** Techniques to vary sentence structure and sound more human.
- **Readability & General Rules:** Formatting, grade level, and Markdown usage.
- **Human Content:** Guidelines for achieving a conversational, less robotic tone.
- **Words to Avoid:** Specific lists of words and phrases to omit.

Refer to the full rules definition placed in your Cursor AI settings for complete details.

## Troubleshooting

- **AI not following the rules?** Make sure the rules are properly pasted in Cursor's Settings (or in your `.cursor/rules/` folder) and that you're using the correct syntax (`@outline:` or `@write:`) in your prompts.
- **Content not appearing in expected location?** Check that the `.content` folder exists or specify a different target folder in your prompt.
- **Need to modify the rules?** You can edit the Rules for AI in Cursor's Settings (or your local `.cursor/rules/` file) any time to adjust the AI's behavior.
